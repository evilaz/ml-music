Experimenting with Machine Learning on the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/).

_(obviously work in progress...)_


Planning to experiment on the following ideas:

* Lyrics-based music annotation

* Lyrics-based song/artist similarity

* Lyrics generation.. (that requires full text lyrics)

* Lyrics-based rating prediction (if data available)




_Datasets/Sources:_

* [The Last.fm Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/lastfm)
* [Additional related Datasets](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/pages/additional-datasets)
